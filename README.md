# Sign-up Form

:arrow_forward: **[Live preview!](https://softy-dev.github.io/sign-up-form/)**

This project provides a signup form for an imaginary company through the use of CSS and HTML. It allows users to join the community by providing their personal information and creating an account. The form features basic client-side validation such as requiring specific patterns for password, e-mail, and phone number. It also accounts for accessibility with clear requirement signaling, proper border styling when the element is focused, valid or invalid, use of instructions over the fields instead of placehold text, and aria-label use for improved screen reader support.
